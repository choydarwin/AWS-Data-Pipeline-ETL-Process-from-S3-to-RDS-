# AWS Data Pipeline: ETL Process from S3 to RDS  

## 🚀 Overview  
This project demonstrates an **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline** using **AWS S3 and RDS**. It focuses on extracting raw data from S3, transforming it using Python, and loading it into a relational database (RDS) for further analysis. The project is designed to showcase my skills in cloud-based data processing and SQL.  

**Note:** The dataset used in this project is sourced from a **Coursera project**

## 🔹 Technologies Used  
- **AWS S3** – Cloud storage for raw data  
- **AWS RDS (MySQL)** – Relational database for structured data storage  
- **Python** – Data transformation and preprocessing  
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation and cleaning  
- **Boto3** – AWS SDK for interacting with S3 and RDS  
- **SQL** – Database management and querying  

---

## 🔄 ETL Workflow  
1. **Extract** – Retrieve raw data from AWS S3.  
2. **Transform** – Clean, preprocess, and structure data using Python and Pandas.  
   - Missing numeric values were filled with the **median** of the respective column.  
   - Missing categorical values were filled with the **most common data** (mode) of the respective column.  
3. **Load** – Insert processed data into AWS RDS using SQL.

## 📌 SQL for Structured Data Management  
SQL is a critical component of this project, enabling structured data management and analysis:  
- **Schema Definition:** SQL scripts create the database schema, ensuring data is organized and accessible.  
- **Data Loading:** SQL `INSERT` statements load the processed data into AWS RDS.  
- **Querying Data:** SQL queries analyze the data, revealing insights and trends.

## 🎯 Key Features  
- ✔️ **Data Retrieval** – Fetch raw data from AWS S3 using Boto3.  
- ✔️ **Data Transformation** – Clean and preprocess data using Python and Pandas, including handling missing values.  
- ✔️ **Data Loading** – Use SQL to create tables and insert processed data into AWS RDS.  
- ✔️ **Scalability** – Designed for scalability and future improvements.

## 📌 Future Enhancements  
- 🔹 **Advanced SQL Queries** – Implement complex SQL queries for deeper analysis.  
- 🔹 **Automated Reporting** – Generate automated reports and dashboards using SQL.    
- 🔹 **Optimization** – Optimize SQL queries and database indexing for better performance.
